= Quick Note =

Next major release I will be removing the logic part of this plugin in favor of two alternatives that I am working on.  One that will add the same feature back into each widget you have and one where you can add widgets from the Page editor.  Hopefully they will be release all at the same time to make sure you have options.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. If you're uploading it make sure to upload the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
